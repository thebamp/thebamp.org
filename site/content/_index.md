    text: >
        In the wake of George Floyd's death, BAMP and other art organizations have taken to Downtown
        Oakland, Chinatown to paint plywood boards on storefronts. The boarded up storefronts serve as great
        canvases to express the need for social change. BAMP hopes that the social justice artwork can be a
        way to inform, heal, and remind the community of the ongoing current events.

        BAMP was a great partner for a Public Art Mural we worked on with them for a K-12 school in
        Oakland. Andre and his team are great to work with and were awesome working with the students.
        Everything was on schedule and the work they did was great! We would recommend them and be
        happy to work with them again on another project.

        We've had the members of BAMP up several times for different mural projects. Every member of
        the team has shown up with a very positive energy, and a strong desire to create with one
        and other as well as us. They've been a pleasure to work with, and we'd absolutely recommend
        the team to anyone seeking out their services.

        I haven’t yet (!) worked with BAMP but can’t help but leave a review of their culture-defining
        and -shaping work, having followed their rise from conception. Knowing one of their muralists
        for almost 30 years, I’ve been able to see their destiny take fruition. To make us ask the hard
        questions, to bring back consideration and compassion in the community, and above all, to
        introduce new cultural concepts through art activism. Five stars doesn’t cut it.

        I love Oakland. We met Andre (Natty Rebel) a few weeks ago as we were walking to dinner.
        He was painting a mural across the street from the restaurant and I asked him if he'd heard
        of the new awesome art store in town. He hadn't. We got to talking a bit, and now he's set
        to adorn the new store with one of his fantastic murals!

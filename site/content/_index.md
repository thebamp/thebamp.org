  - title: Plywood Murals
    text: >
      In the wake of George Floyd's death, BAMP and other art organizations have
      taken to Downtown Oakland, Chinatown to paint plywood boards on
      storefronts. The boarded up storefronts serve as great canvases to express
      the need for social change. BAMP hopes that the social justice artwork can
      be a way to inform, heal, and remind the community of the ongoing current
      events.

      During the pandemic local creative organizations such as BAMP have faced
      the challenges of rapid development, making it hard to stay in our
      communities and do this significant work.


      By giving to this campaign you’ll support us in continuing our mission of artistic excellence, education, and community enrichment. We ask that you consider a sponsorship donation, where you will be honored at our event.

      BAMP was a great partner for a Public Art Mural we worked on with them for
      a K-12 school in Oakland. Andre and his team are great to work with and
      were awesome working with the students. Everything was on schedule and the
      work they did was great! We would recommend them and be happy to work with
      them again on another project.

      We've had the members of BAMP up several times for different mural
      projects. Every member of the team has shown up with a very positive
      energy, and a strong desire to create with one and other as well as us.
      They've been a pleasure to work with, and we'd absolutely recommend the
      team to anyone seeking out their services.

      I haven’t yet (!) worked with BAMP but can’t help but leave a review of
      their culture-defining and -shaping work, having followed their rise from
      conception. Knowing one of their muralists for almost 30 years, I’ve been
      able to see their destiny take fruition. To make us ask the hard
      questions, to bring back consideration and compassion in the community,
      and above all, to introduce new cultural concepts through art activism.
      Five stars doesn’t cut it.

      I love Oakland. We met Andre (Natty Rebel) a few weeks ago as we were
      walking to dinner. He was painting a mural across the street from the
      restaurant and I asked him if he'd heard of the new awesome art store in
      town. He hadn't. We got to talking a bit, and now he's set to adorn the
      new store with one of his fantastic murals!
